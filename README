surf - simple webkit-based browser
==================================
surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+.

Requirements
------------
In order to build surf you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.

In order to use the functionality of the url-bar and/or search bar, also install dmenu[0].

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (surf is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install surf (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running surf
------------
run
	surf [URI]

Functionality
-------------
To add tabs you may want to install tabbed[1], and run surf like this:

    tabbed -c surf -e

Patches
-------
	dlconsole[2]
	model[2]
	scrollmultiply[2]
	websearch[5]

Cleanup
------
All surf config files have been moved to ~/.config/surf
as apposed to ~/.surf.

All keybinds no longer need a CTRL, simply press the keybind.
If you need to type into a text box, press `i` to enter insert mode,
and press `esc` to exit. Similar behiear can be found in qutebrowser[6]
and vimb[7].

When using `y` to yank current url, it sends it to `CLIPBOARD` rather
then `PRIMARY`.

See the manpage for further options.

Video Support
-------------
In order to have robust video support, install these packages. (Arch Specific)
	- gstreamer
	- gst-libav
	- gst-plugins-{base,ugly,bad,good}
	- libde265
